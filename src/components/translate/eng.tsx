    <div>The passion began with the wood burning, one time even led a children's club to wood burning.But with the birth of a son, the wife forbidden to "smoke" in the home and the artist began to do wood carvings.</div>
    <div>Initially inspiration the author was experiencing from such artists as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Konenkov">Sergey Konenkov</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepan_Erzia">Stepan Erzia</a></div>

        The artist always experiments in his works. As an engineer for non-standard equipment, trying to solve the problem in the conditions of limited space occupied by the initial raw material for crafts.Trying to use a native combination of materials and non-standard processing methods.
        Not always the crafts of the author have a utilitarian nature, often it is just a "flight" of fantasy, some abstraction in the tree. This makes it possible to fantasize those who are the owner of the artist's products.
